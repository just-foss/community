# what is the just-foss organisation?

The aim of just-foss organisation it to be a free, opensource, remote, regular meeting, written by and for hackers in computer science. 

We want to provide a community which is not driven by status, but rather by content and real humanity.

During the meetings we talk about topics that might be interesting for others in different domains.

The aim of just-foss is to be an indipendent content from any organisation, programming languages, stereotypes.

Although, the just-foss community will favor when possible functional code over object oriented code.

# Which type of talks are wanted

A talk should be at least something NOT commercial/business driven. It should aim to be honest, and driven by quality, for sharing with people.

It can be a pure theoretical one, e.g Queue theories, or can be mixed by a theory and pragmatic approach.

For example some domains:  #ai #networking #linux #functional programming #software-design #architecure #security #performance #monitoring etc.

The main goal of just-foss, would aim to share valid knowledge for people to different domains.

# How a remote meetings looks like:

We will do a remote meeting when we have at least 4 talks. Each talk should from 20/40 minutes  duration, with slides, examples etc.

The meeting will happen via an opensource video/sharing tool.

We will **not** register any meetings. The reason behind this is that we want to build a human, trusted network beetween professionals, students and any programmer around.
Having an ephimeral non recorded meeting enforce people to be more relaxed and honest, since it will be just for the people attending.

We will do preferrably meetings with camera, but if people don't want to show up for some reason, we don't require it, allthough showing up create more connections feeling :)

After the presentation, attendees can raise question, if not they can still get in contact via Issues etc with the presenter, if they have later question.

# How can I be part of the movement?

* If you want to present something, open an issue here and describe what you want to talk about, how long it should be, and why you think your content is something useful to share.

* If you want to just listen, have a look at the twitter #justfoss tag and other medias, or the other issue in GitHub. We shouldn't have problems with different attendes.

* If you want to be a maintainer of #justfoss, feel free to write us why you want to be part of the organisation.
  We are searching for new maintainers and welcome diversity, allthough beeing a maintainer isn't necessary for listen or present.
